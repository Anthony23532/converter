# Unit Converter Application

## Overview
The **Unit Converter Application** is a Python-based program that allows users to convert between various units across multiple categories, such as Length, Temperature, Time, Speed, and Volume. It features a user-friendly graphical interface with tooltips, error handling, and a modern look using `ttkbootstrap`.

## Features
- **Length Conversions**: Convert between meters and kilometers.
- **Temperature Conversions**: Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Time Conversions**: Convert between seconds and minutes.
- **Speed Conversions**: Convert between kilometers per hour and meters per second.
- **Volume Conversions**: Convert between liters and milliliters.
- **Modern GUI**: Built using `tkinter` and styled with `ttkbootstrap`.
- **Tooltips**: Tooltips for all inputs and buttons to enhance usability.
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and custom error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear inputs and results with a single click.

## Requirements
To run the application, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- `ttkbootstrap` library

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the code.
   git clone "https://github.com/yourusername/unit_converter.git"
   cd unit_converter

## Usage

- Select Units: Choose the unit you want to convert from in the first dropdown and the unit you want to convert to in the second dropdown.
- Enter Value: Input the value you wish to convert in the text field.
- Convert: Press the "Convert" button to perform the conversion.
- Reset: Press the "Reset" button to clear all fields and start a new conversion.

## Example Conversions

- Length:
Meters to Kilometers: Enter 1000 in the text field, select "Meters" as the 'From Unit', and "Kilometers" as the 'To Unit'. The result will display 1.00.

- Temperature:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: Enter 0, select "Celsius" as the 'From Unit', and "Fahrenheit" as the 'To Unit'. The result will display 32.00.

- Time:
Seconds to Minutes: Enter 120, select "Seconds" as the 'From Unit', and "Minutes" as the 'To Unit'. The result will display 2.00.
